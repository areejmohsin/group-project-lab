Our program takes a name input and another input that asks the user to solve a mathematical equation. Then, the program prints the user's name and their answer. This was created by Alex Coffman and Areej Mohsin.

To install our program, you need to access JupyterHub and clone our repository. If your directory is /group-project-lab/, then you are in the right place. Anyone who can access my repository can fork it, clone it to JupyterHub using the git clone command, and add their own programs to it. 

How to access my repository:
1) Fork it 
2) Copy the url and, in your JupyterHub command line terminal, type git clone and paste the url
3) Open the folder
4) Add whatever you'd like
5) Save it and push it to your repository
6) Pull request to add your program to the main repository (my repository)

Usage:
x = input("what is your name? ") --> prompts the user to enter their name --> no captalization needed --> name is stored in variable x
y = input("what is 2 plus 2? ") --> promps the user to enter their answer to the question --> any variable type is acceptable --> answer is stored in the variable y
System prints the user's name and answer by concatenating str and variables

Our code cannot be used for harm, exploitation, or discrimination. Also, people cannot copy our code and use it maliciously. Please make your additions appropriate for our program.

We went with our license because we didn't want to restrict what users can add to our program, but we made our code of conduct to ensure that users make their programs school appropriate and don't use it maliciously.
